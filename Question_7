7. How many individuals have an income higher than the average income?

The query below shows who gain a higher income than the average income of the data set. 

SELECT
	ID,
  Income,
  (SELECT AVG(Income) FROM risk_behavior_features) AS 'Average'
FROM risk_behavior_features
WHERE Income > (SELECT AVG(Income) FROM risk_behavior_features);

To get the number of individuals who respect the condition below and compare it with the total number of records, I have used the query below:

SELECT
	COUNT(ID) AS 'Count',
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM risk_behavior_features) AS 'Total'
FROM risk_behavior_features
WHERE Income > (SELECT AVG(Income) FROM risk_behavior_features);

This means that 39 of 73 individuals (53.42%) get a higher salary than the average.  The income distribution is relatively balanced, but slightly shifted towards higher incomes.
