1.	What gender has the highest level of education (Doctorate)?

Using the query below, we can see that there is almost the same level of education for genders, equal between female and male.

SELECT
	Gender,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Education_Level = 'Doctorate' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Doctorate',
    COUNT(*) AS 'Total',
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Education_Level = 'Doctorate' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS 'Doctorate_Percentage'
FROM risk_behavior_features
GROUP BY Gender
ORDER BY Gender;

So, most of the people who have a doctorate degree are non-binary because 8 represent 50% of 16, 6 females with doctorate represents 24% out of total females and 6 males with doctorate represents 19% out of total males. Between females and males, it seems that more women have doctorate degree than men, because there are fewer women than men in this data set.
