6. What is the average and the median of the income column?

The average income is 68,189 dollars, while the median income is 70,978.
This difference indicates that the income distribution is right-skewed, meaning that a relatively small number of individuals earn significantly higher incomes, which pulls the average upward.
The median therefore provides a more accurate representation of a normal value of the income level in the dataset, as it is less affected by extreme values.

SELECT
	(SELECT ROUND(AVG(Income), 2) FROM risk_behavior_features) AS 'Average',
  (SELECT ROUND(AVG(Income),2)
	FROM (
		SELECT
		  Income,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Income) AS 'rn',
			COUNT(*) OVER () AS 'Total'
		FROM risk_behavior_features
    ) AS m
		  WHERE rn IN (FLOOR((Total + 1) / 2), CEIL ((Total + 1) / 2))) AS 'Median';
