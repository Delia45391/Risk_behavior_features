3.	Which marital status has the highest credit score?

The query below shows that the single people have the highest credit score, which means they are most likely to pay debts on time. The divorced ones may find it difficult to pay all debts on time. Without partner or other financial support, from family or friends, it’s harder to pay debts, while making other expenses, especially if the divorced ones are also parents or have to take care for someone from the family.

SELECT 
	Marital_Status,
  MAX(Credit_Score) AS 'Highest_Credit_Score'
FROM risk_behavior_features
GROUP BY Marital_Status
ORDER BY MAX(Credit_Score) DESC;
