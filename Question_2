2.	What is the average income for each education level?
Using the following query, I have calculated the average income depending on the education level. I have added also a column to count the number of people based on their education level and determined the highest value of the income depending on the education level. This columns help to get a better insight about the salary someone can expect depending on their studies.

SELECT 
	Education_Level,
  COUNT(Education_Level) AS 'Total_Education_Level',
  AVG(Income) AS 'Average_Income',
  MAX(Income) AS 'Maximum_Income'
FROM risk_behavior_features
GROUP BY Education_Level
ORDER BY AVG(Income) DESC;

These being said, the ones who finished high school have the highest average income, but the highest salary is owned by someone whith Bachelor degree, followed by Doctorate degree.  Also, the average income for the doctorate degree is the second highest, after high school. Graduating from university does not guarantee a satisfactory salary, but we also need to consider the fact that only 2 of the repondents of the survey have graduated high school, so it is pretty hard to have such a big amount of money without a college degree.
